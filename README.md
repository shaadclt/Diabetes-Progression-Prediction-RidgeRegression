# Diabetes Progression Prediction using Ridge Regression

This project involves the prediction of diabetes progression using Ridge Regression in Jupyter Notebook. The dataset contains features such as glucose level, blood pressure, body mass index, and more. Through this analysis, we aim to build a regression model that accurately predicts the progression of diabetes based on the given input features.

## Dataset

The diabetes dataset used for this analysis includes various features related to diabetes patients, such as glucose level, blood pressure, body mass index, and the target variable: diabetes progression.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Getting Started

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaadclt/Diabetes-Progression-Prediction-RidgeRegression.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd Diabetes-Progression-Prediction-RidgeRegression
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

4. Run Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. Open the `Diabetes Progression Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

6. Run the notebook cells to load the dataset, perform data preprocessing, train the Ridge Regression model, and evaluate its performance.

## Analysis Overview

The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to predict diabetes progression using Ridge Regression. The analysis includes the following tasks:

- Loading and understanding the dataset
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and transformation
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Training the Ridge Regression model
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared score
- Making predictions on new data points

## Results and Insights

After training the model and evaluating its performance, you will gain insights into how well the Ridge Regression model predicts diabetes progression based on the given input features. The notebook includes performance metrics and visualizations to assess the accuracy of the model. Feel free to refer to the notebook for detailed results and interpretations.

## Customization

You can customize the analysis to suit your specific requirements. For example, you can experiment with different feature engineering techniques, try different regression algorithms, or incorporate additional features from the dataset to improve the model's accuracy.
